# whole point is that it is easy to read in with lines

# this video may be silly because best to just have char attribute, rather than lines
#Â this way you wouldn't need to handle lines in the UI or the text class
# or actually if you have characters attribute, ask viewers to look past this
# or make a note at the end. Doesn't need to be perfect, doesn't need to stop me making video.
